The calibrator and other useful utilities for TI wireless solution,
based on wl12xx driver.


--- Build procedure

Make sure your kernel is configured to support nl80211 testmode commands.
(NL80211_TESTMODE=y)
There is dependents on libnl package.

Set follow environment variables:
export NFSROOT=<path to roofs of a target where installed libnl library>
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
make


--- Running PLT utility

1. Have to prepare NVS reference file
	a. Boot the system
	b. Create NVS reference file
		./calibrator set ref_nvs ./<ini file>
	c. Copy newly created NVS file to the proper place:
		cp new-nvs.bin /lib/firmware/wl1271-nvs.bin
2. Calibrate the system
	a. Reboot the system
		While booting the system do not start wireless device
		interface. Make sure it is down, by running 
		command: `ifconfig'.
	b. Calibrate
		./calibrator plt calibrate
	c. Copy newly created file to the proper place
		cp new-nvs.bin /lib/firmware/wl1271-nvs.bin
3. Reboot the system

--- INI files

It is very important to select INI file according to the firmware (see below).

Those files organized in 3 directories:
station - currently supported station firmware (wl1271-fw.bin)
access_point - currently supported access point (wl1271-fw-ap.bin)
development - files for firmware under release stage 

--- Firmware files

The firmware files can be reached from git repository
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dwmw2/linux-firmware.git
under directory ti-connectivity.
There are 2 firmware files there:
wl1271-fw.bin    - station firmware
wl1271-fw-ap.bin    - access point firmware

--- Detailed instructions for calibrator procedures

	TxBip procedure (calibration)

It is importand to set MAC address to an interface before the procedure.
For example, `ifconfig wlan0 hw ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx'
There are 2 ways to do it - short where all parameters has default values and
full where you have to set all parameters manualy.

Short way:
calibrator plt calibrate

Full way:
calibrator wlan0 plt power_mode on
calibrator wlan0 plt ref_point <voltage> <power> <subband>
calibrator wlan0 plt tx_bip <0|1> <0|1> <0|1> <0|1> <0|1> <0|1> <0|1> <0|1>
calibrator wlan0 plt power_mode off

Result of this procedure is new NVS file created localy ./new-nvs.bin
In order to use it, copy the file to /lib/firmware/wl1271-nvs.bin and reload.

	TxCont procedure

calibrator wlan0 plt power_mode on
calibrator wlan0 plt tune_channel <band> <channel>
calibrator wlan0 plt tx_cont <delay> <rate> <size> <amount> <power> <seed> <pkt mode> <DC on/off> <gi> <preamble> <type> <scramble> <clpc> <seq nbr mode> <dest mac>
calibrator wlan0 plt tx_stop
calibrator wlan0 plt power_mode off

Description: This test sends packets of data directly to air. It receives 
several parameters as described bellow, to enable diversity of
operational modes.
It is mostly used to see Energy and radio impact on Air.
Content of Packet can be Random, or Zero, One, Zero, one...
Packets send are configurable in the following aspects:
  Delay between packets in microseconds
  Rate
    1 Mbps -   0x00000001       MCS_0 - 0x00002000
    2 Mbps -   0x00000002       MCS_1 - 0x00004000
    5.5 Mbps - 0x00000004       MCS_2 - 0x00008000
    6 Mbps -   0x00000008       MCS_3 - 0x00010000
    9 Mbps -   0x00000010       MCS_4 - 0x00020000
    11 Mbps -  0x00000020       MCS_5 - 0x00040000
    12 Mbps -  0x00000040       MCS_6 - 0x00080000
    18 Mbps -  0x00000080       MCS_7 - 0x00100000
    24 Mbps -  0x00000200
    36 Mbps -  0x00000400
    48 Mbps -  0x00000800
    54 Mbps -  0x00001000
  Size of data field in MPDU (in bytes, 0 - 2284)
  Amount - number of packets in case of using series mode
  Power - output power in dBm*1000
  Seed - value for the scrambler
  Packet mode - 0-single, 1-multipile, 3-continuos, 4-FCC
  DC on/off - activate DCF
  gi - guard interval on/off for 11n rates
  Preamble
    1 Mbps - long preamble mode=0
    2, 5.5, 11 Mbps - long preamble mode=0, short preamble mode=1
    6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54 Mbps - ofdm preamble mode=4
    from MCS_0 to MCS_7 - n mixed mode preamble mode=6, greenfield preamble mode=7
  Type is 0-data packet, 1-ack, 2-probe req, 3-random data, 4-user data
  Scrambler - on/off
  CLPC
    range 0-100 is disable calibration
  Sequence number mode (incremented or fixed)
  Destination Mac address

	RxStat procedure

There are 2 ways to do it - short where all parameters has default values and
full where you have to set all parameters manualy.

Short way:
calibrator plt rx_statistics

In the short way each time the statistics will be reseted.

Full way:
calibrator wlan0 plt power_mode on
calibrator wlan0 plt start_rx_statcs
calibrator wlan0 plt get_rx_statcs
calibrator wlan0 plt stop_rx_statcs
calibrator wlan0 plt power_mode off

While willing to reset the statistic run:
calibrator wlan0 plt reset_rx_statcs

	Miscelanious procedures

Read MAC address from NVS file:
calibrator get nvs_mac <nvs filename>

Set MAC address in NVS file:
calibrator set nvs_mac <mac addr xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx> <nvs file>

Push local NVS to the system:
calibrator phy <phyname> set push_nvs <nvs filename>
